# sscClust
simpler single cell RNAseq data clustering (sscClust), is a package implement mutilple functionalities which are basic procedures in single cell RNAseq data analysis, including variable genes identification, dimension reduction, clustering on reduced data. Also some new ideas were proposed, such as projecting data to a feature space using spearman correlation which make visualiaztion and clustering more efficient, clustering with subsampling and classfification which make it feasible to process thousands cells' data.

Tutorials can be found in the vignettes.
